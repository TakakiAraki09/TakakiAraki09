While investigating the file of Shin Inaba, an anesthesiologist connected to the crime, the case takes a dark turn when Zen finds a page stained with a mixture of blood, hair and skin, along with the letter \"F\" scribbled all across the sheet. As he investigates further, the case goes beyond Zen's imagination and becomes vastly complex, challenging his sense of justice and his knowledge of the truth. \n\nDigging deeper into the investigation, Zen begins to uncover a concealed plot behind the ongoing mayoral election and ties to many people of interest involved in the election and those closer than he thinks. The case grows more severe and propels Zen into an unforeseen hurricane of corruption and deceit behind the election, the establishment of the Shiniki district, and the mysterious woman associated with it all. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To this end, he publicly states his intention to study theology—the academic field held in highest regard in early 15th century Poland. However, an encounter with a mysterious man upends Rafal's life, sparking an illogical desire to instead pursue his passion for astronomy.\n\nRafal is determined to prove the beauty and rationality of heliocentrism—the theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun. This belief is considered heretical by the powerful Church, which promotes geocentrism—the Sun revolving around the Earth—as the sole truth of the universe. Those whose beliefs do not align with the will of the Church suffer unfathomably gruesome consequences.\n\nIn pursuit of evidence for a heliocentric model of the universe, Rafal grapples with obtaining precise calculations and building empirical theories. His greatest challenge, however, lies in conducting this research discreetly—lest he wish to meet the same fate as other heretics.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The ingenious 17-year-old Japanese student Light Yagami and sadistic god of death Ryuk share one belief: their worlds are rotten.\n\nFor his own amusement, Ryuk drops his Death Note into the human world. Light stumbles upon it, deeming the first of its rules ridiculous: the human whose name is written in this note shall die. However, the temptation is too great, and Light experiments by writing a felon's name, which disturbingly enacts his first murder.\n\nAware of the terrifying godlike power that has fallen into his hands, Light—under the alias Kira—follows his wicked sense of justice with the ultimate goal of cleansing the world of all evil-doers. The meticulous mastermind detective L is already on his trail, but as Light's brilliance rivals L's, the grand chase for Kira turns into an intense battle of wits that can only end when one of them is dead.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",

However, when a powerful dragon eats Falin, Laios' spellcasting sister, she sends her brother and his companions back to the beginning to save them from permanent ends.\n\nThough strapped for cash and equipment, Laios resolves to fight his way through the dungeon and rescue Falin before she can be digested by the dragon. Despite some of Laios' allies abandoning him, two remain by his side: elven mage Marcille Donato and halfling locksmith Chilchuck Tims. Due to their lack of funds, the party faces the daunting prospect of starving before being able to complete their quest. However, they find salvation in Senshi, a dwarven warrior with a penchant for cooking and safely eating defeated monsters.\n\nWith Senshi's culinary expertise, Laios and his companions struggle through the dungeon while learning about gourmet dining—and each other—along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Following the conclusion of the third Grail War, a US-based organization with magi distinct from the London-based Mage Association, used data from Fuyuki's Grail War to plan their own ritual. Seventy years later, they used the city of Snowfield as the Sacred Land for their own Grail War. However, they were unable to successfully replicate every aspect of the ritual, resulting in it acting only as an imitation that has lost the Saber class and allowed for the summoning of strange Servants due to the blurring of the definition of a \"hero.\"\n\nRohngall and his pupil, Faldeus, have been dispatched by the Mage's Association to investigate the city and the state of the war. Faldeus, a US organization spy, has Rohngall sniped upon his arrival, despite knowing that Rohngall is a puppet. He declares that their Holy Grail War has been in development and is real, causing a commotion at the Clock Tower, and that he wishes to \"advertise\" the project to the Association.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

Among the four other crew members is a Gnosia: a Gnos infectee whose goal is the eradication of humanity. The Gnosia appears human in all other respects, so the uninfected have little choice but to vote on whom they suspect to be the enemy, hoping to neutralize the Gnosia by putting them into cold sleep. If the Gnosia survives the vote, they will eliminate one crew member during the cruiser's following warp, when only the Gnosia remains conscious.\n\nVoting quickly proves to be an unreliable strategy, and Yuuri is left one-on-one with the Gnosia. Just when all hope seems lost, time seemingly loops back to when Yuuri first awakened. With each time loop, however, conditions aboard the ship change—neither the size of the crew nor the members' identities remain constant. Trapped in both time and space, Yuuri must figure out how to escape the loops and save humanity from the Gnosia.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately for him, skills of this nature are considered useless due to their low success rate, and Touka is thus assigned the title of E-rank hero. Things take a further turn for the worse when Vicius, the goddess who summoned the class, reveals that the lowest-ranked hero will be disposed of so that they do not hinder those with greater talent.\n\nBanished to a notoriously dangerous area, Touka comes face-to-face with death after being cornered by a minotaur-like creature. In a desperate attempt to survive, he uses his supposedly worthless skill—only to quickly realize that it works almost every time. Armed with the ability to render the monsters standing in his way completely helpless, Touka resolves to track down the goddess that tossed him aside and exact his revenge.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Remembering every battle they fought together, she pledges unwavering loyalty to Takuto once more.\n\nAs Takuto begins to build Mynoghra from scratch in this new world, his early-game strategy remains unchanged: lie low, avoid war, and ensure survival at all costs—ironic for an evil ruler meant to conquer the world. When he offers refuge to persecuted Dark Elves fleeing destruction, a fledgling empire born of a darkness the world has yet to understand begins to take shape.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After Dario's death 12 years later, George—hoping to repay his debt—adopts his son, Dio. \n\nWhile he publicly fawns over his new father, Dio secretly plans to steal the Joestar fortune. His first step is to create a divide between George and Jonathan. By constantly outdoing his foster brother, Dio firmly makes his place in the Joestar family. But when Dio pushes Jonathan too far, Jonathan defeats him in a brawl. \n\nYears later, the two appear to be close friends to the outside world. But trouble brews again when George falls ill, as Jonathan suspects that Dio is somehow behind the incident—and it appears he has more tricks up his sleeve.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Instead, he cleans up the remains of the slaughtered kaijuu after they are defeated by valiant soldiers—including Mina, who has successfully achieved their shared goal.\n\nUpon meeting his new coworker, Reno Ichikawa, Kafka faces a mirror of his past self: an ambitious young man whose one desire is to fight as a member of the Defense Force. Unfortunately, the two are soon involved in a freak encounter with a rogue kaijuu. Though Kafka demonstrates his innate heroic nature and rescues Reno from certain doom, he is left gravely injured.\n\nWhile both men recover in a hospital, Kafka is seemingly attacked by another one of the beasts. As a result, he gains the ability to transform into a humanoid kaijuu with the strength and powers of the massive monsters menacing Japan. Dubbed \"Kaijuu No. 8\" by the military, Kafka resolves to use his newfound gifts for the greater good. Tied together by mutual respect, Kafka and Reno set out to join warriors like Mina at the forefront of the Defense Force.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Kafka is the first kaijuu to side with humans, and after careful consideration, he is eventually transferred to the Defense Force's First Division in the hope of adding his power to the strongest division, capable of handling any threat. However, some people are still doubtful about Kafka, and he must prove his worth in the next mission.\n\nKafka and the First Division are soon dispatched when a massive horde of ant-like kaijuu begins wreaking havoc. Thanks to the combined strength of Kafka's friend Kikoru Shinomiya and their captain, Gen Narumi, the mission seems to progress as it should. However, when Kafka fails to transform into his kaijuu form, the dreadful Kaijuu No. 9 joins the battle with only one goal—to eliminate him and steal his power. Although the situation is looking grim, Kafka must overcome his most difficult trial yet with the others if he wants to keep pursuing his dream: fighting side by side with his childhood friend and Third Division captain, Mina Ashiro.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Many have become astounding swordsmen themselves, but Beryl remains quite humble, referring to himself as an old man. His former disciples all disagree, including Allucia Citrus, a girl who graduated from Beryl's training over 10 years ago and is currently the commander of the Royal Order of Knights.\n\nWishing to reveal her cherished teacher's true greatness, Allucia recommends Beryl to her superiors, leading to his appointment as a special instructor for the Order by imperial command. She delivers the news herself—though Beryl has yet to realize her deeper motive. Pressured by his aging parents, Beryl reluctantly accepts the job and moves to the capital. There, he meets more of his past students, such as Surena Lysandra, now a black-rank adventurer, and Ficelle Harbeller, a prominent member of the Magic Corps. Before long, word begins to spread: not even the strongest warriors can match the \"old man\" from the countryside.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

This unkempt, shy, and stuttering girl has actually been Fujino's biggest fan all along. Their encounter reignites Fujino's passion for art and sparks the beginning of a years-long friendship built on rivalry, admiration, and their shared love of manga.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To put an end to this seemingly endless conflict, Demon King Anos Voldigoad willingly sacrificed his life, hoping to be reborn in a peaceful future.\n\nIn preparation for their king's return, the demon race created the Demon King Academy, an elite institution tasked with determining Anos' identity when he reawakens.

Moreover, when he enrolls at the academy to reclaim his rightful title, he finds out that demonkind remembers him differently. His personality, his deeds, and even his legacy are all falsified—masked beneath the name of an impostor. This \"lack\" of common knowledge renders him the academy's outlier—a misfit never before seen in history.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, Anos remains unfazed. As he sets out to uncover those altering his glorious past, he takes it upon himself to make his descendants recognize that their ruler has finally returned.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

While lamenting the prospect of living an ordinary life, he is suddenly drawn into the world of Mato: an alternate dimension filled with dangerous monsters called Shuuki. Over the years since the existence of Mato was first confirmed, incidents of people accidentally wandering into the other world have become commonplace. To combat the threat of the Shuuki and rescue victims like Yuuki, the all-female Demon Defense Force was established. Its members have been blessed with the power of \"Peaches\"—Mato fruits that grant supernatural abilities only to women.\n\nThough Yuuki's situation is dire, he is saved in the nick of time by Kyouka Uzen, the chief of the Demon Defense Force's seventh unit. Despite Kyouka's impeccable skills in battle, she has long been held back by her Peach-granted ability, Slave. Slave allows Kyouka to put a living being under her control and draw out its strength, but the Shuuki that she had enslaved until now had all proven to be exceedingly weak.\n\nWhen Yuuki and Kyouka become surrounded by a horde of Shuuki, Kyouka resorts to something she has never tried before: using her ability on a man. To her surprise, Yuuki's slave form is much more powerful than she could have imagined. Believing the young man to be the key to unlocking her true potential, Kyouka invites Yuuki to join the Demon Defense Force—but not as a regular member.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In the 22nd century, Japan enforces the Sibyl System, an objective means of determining the threat level of each citizen by examining their mental state for signs of criminal intent, known as their Psycho-Pass. Inspectors uphold the law by subjugating, often with lethal force, anyone harboring the slightest ill-will; alongside them are Enforcers, citizens that have become latent criminals, granted relative freedom in exchange for carrying out the Inspectors' dirty work.\n\nInto this world steps Akane Tsunemori, a young woman with an honest desire to uphold justice. However, as she works alongside veteran Enforcer Shinya Kougami, she soon learns that the Sibyl System's judgments are not as perfect as her fellow Inspectors assume. With everything she has known turned on its head, Akane wrestles with the question of what justice truly is, and whether it can be upheld through the use of a system that may already be corrupt.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, the great spirit Puck helps a young girl break out of her ice prison.

Burdened with a sin of destruction she does not remember committing, she spends her days trying to find a way to help her frozen kin.

Will the bonds of ice she formed with Puck prove to be the warm thread that defies fate?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After all, his tireless efforts catch the Demon Lord's attention; he deems Uchimura the perfect candidate to fill the vacant spot among the Four Heavenly Generals.\n\nDespite Uchimura being an ordinary human, he earns the Demon Lord's recognition through his knack for solving impossible situations—a skill he honed through years as an overseas manager. With rising dissension among the demon army and failing negotiations with other tribes, it is up to Uchimura to justify the faith bestowed upon him and bring one final push for the Demon Lord's vision of dominance and perfection.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

These merciless murderers only leave behind scant remainders of souls called \"Torches,\" which are mere residues that will eventually be destroyed, along with the very fact of the victims' existence from the minds of the living. In an ambitious endeavor to put an end to this invisible, hungry massacre, warriors called Flame Hazes relentlessly fight these monsters.\n\nOne fateful day, Yuuji Sakai ceases to be a regular high schooler—he becomes trapped in a crevice of time and is suddenly attacked by a Denizen. Coming to his rescue just in the nick of time is a nameless hunter who seems no different from an ordinary young girl except for her blazing eyes and burning crimson hair. However, before Yuuji can learn anything more about his situation, he discovers that he has already been reduced to a Torch—merely a scrap of memory waiting to be extinguished.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But while it is a Flame Haze's duty to protect humans, Shana—the \"Flame-Haired Burning-Eyed Hunter\"—seems to be focusing her attention on one human in particular: Yuuji Sakai, a teenage boy who was unwittingly dragged into the fight between Crimson Denizens and Flame Hazes. Since her first encounter with Yuuji, Shana has started to see him as more than just a friend. In fact, Yuuji wonders if Shana might have revealed her feelings to him once before, but it is difficult for him to confirm due to her hot-and-cold personality. Nonetheless, their days pass like any other, until a new transfer student arrives at their high school—one who bears a striking resemblance to an old enemy.\n\nYuuji and Shana have no time to dance around their feelings for each other; while their adversaries from the Bal Masqué organization plan their next attack, the two must keep their guard up as they explore the origin behind the coveted magical object within Yuuji's body, the \"Midnight Lost Child.\"\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The few who share his hobby might recognize him by his in-game name, Sunraku. For his next game, Rakurou is recommended Shangri-La Frontier, a popular and well-received virtual reality game as a breather from the terrible games he has been playing recently.\n\nOnce he boots up the game, Rakurou decides to sell off most of his starting gear to gain extra money, leaving himself with only a pair of boxers, a bird mask, and some weapons. He is instantly hooked as he meticulously levels up his avatar. However, after encountering some intimidating monsters, he realizes that he may have underestimated the challenge that a mainstream game can offer. As Rakurou progresses, he must draw on all the skills he has perfected from his previous gaming experience. Before long, Sunraku's eccentric playstyle takes Shangri-La Frontier by storm.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure.

However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal Titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.\n\nAfter witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Eren, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman, and his childhood friend Armin Arlert join the brutal war against the Titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Encouraged by his girlfriend, Yuki Osanai—a seemingly average second-year student—Urino convinces the newspaper club to let him pursue an unusual story. A case of small-scale fires has escalated into serial arson, and Urino intends to predict the locations of future fires and identify the culprit. But his obsession with the case does not always reflect well on the club, and Osanai may not be so fond of her boyfriend's growing arrogance.\n\nMeanwhile, another supposedly unexceptional student, Jougorou Kobato, spends uneventful days with his girlfriend, Tokiko Nakamaru. However, when he witnesses a fire tied to a past case and Osanai herself, Kobato cannot help but slip back into his old, less-than-ordinary habits in search of the truth.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He lands on Earth, but quickly finds himself in danger of captivity by its inhabitants. Fortunately, he is found by an unsmiling little girl named Shizuka Kuze, who feeds him and names him Takopii. Feeling indebted, Takopii decides to do everything in his power to bring a smile to her face.\n\nThe task is easier said than done, however. Shizuka is bullied by her classmates, she does not have a father, and her mother is never home—though the gravity of these issues flies over the naive Takopii's head. Even so, Shizuka does have one source of happiness: her dog Chappy. The connection Shizuka and Chappy share only increases Takopii's desire to make the girl smile.\n\nWhile Takopii's attempts to lift Shizuka's spirits lead to unintended consequences, he is determined to take things into his own tentacles, test his understanding of human beings, and achieve his goal of spreading happiness.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Melromarc is a country plagued by the Waves of Catastrophe that have repeatedly ravaged the land and brought disaster to its citizens for centuries. The four heroes are respectively bestowed a sword, spear, bow, and shield to vanquish these Waves. Naofumi Iwatani, an otaku, becomes cursed with the fate of being the \"Shield Hero.\" Armed with only a measly shield, Naofumi is belittled and ridiculed by his fellow heroes and the kingdom's people due to his weak offensive capabilities and lackluster personality.\n\nWhen the heroes are provided with resources and comrades to train with, Naofumi sets out with the only person willing to train alongside him, Malty Melromarc. He is soon betrayed by her, however, and becomes falsely accused of taking advantage of her. Naofumi then becomes heavily discriminated against and hated by the people of Melromarc for something he didn't do. With a raging storm of hurt and mistrust in his heart, Naofumi begins his journey of strengthening himself and his reputation. Further along however, the difficulty of being on his own sets in, so Naofumi buys a demi-human slave on the verge of death named Raphtalia to accompany him on his travels.\n\nAs the Waves approach the kingdom, Naofumi and Raphtalia must fight for the survival of the kingdom and protect the people of Melromarc from their ill-fated future.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He meets various demihumans and mythical beings who all end up being captivated with his characteristics and join Makoto in building a new community where all of them can peacefully coexist.\n\nNevertheless, despite this success, Makoto still yearns to meet fellow humans. In a world where the goddess herself has barred him from interacting with his kind, it is up to Makoto and his companions to fulfill his desire—and perhaps reform society along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

War is his home now. Though his father once told him, \"You have no enemies, nobody does. There is nobody who it's okay to hurt,\" as he grew, Thorfinn knew that nothing was further from the truth.\n\nThe war between England and the Danes grows worse with each passing year. Death has become commonplace, and the viking mercenaries are loving every moment of it. Allying with either side will cause a massive swing in the balance of power, and the vikings are happy to make names for themselves and take any spoils they earn along the way. Among the chaos, Thorfinn must take his revenge and kill Askeladd, the man who murdered his father. The only paradise for the vikings, it seems, is the era of war and death that rages on.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "In the entertainment world, celebrities often show exaggerated versions of themselves to the public, concealing their true thoughts and struggles beneath elaborate lies. Fans buy into these fabrications, showering their idols with undying love and support, until something breaks the illusion. Sixteen-year-old rising star Ai Hoshino of pop idol group B Komachi has the world captivated; however, when she announces a hiatus due to health concerns, the news causes many to become worried.\n\nAs a huge fan of Ai, gynecologist Gorou Amemiya cheers her on from his countryside medical practice, wishing he could meet her in person one day. His wish comes true when Ai shows up at his hospital—not sick, but pregnant with twins! While the doctor promises Ai to safely deliver her children, he wonders if this encounter with the idol will forever change the nature of his relationship with her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "With the help of producer Masaya Kaburagi, Aquamarine \"Aqua\" Hoshino and Kana Arima have landed the roles of Touki and Tsurugi in Lala Lai Theatrical Company's stage adaptation of the popular manga series Tokyo Blade. Co-starring with them is Aqua's girlfriend, Akane Kurokawa, who plays Touki's fiancée, Princess Saya. Due to the fanbase preferring Tsurugi as Touki's love interest, Saya has made fewer and fewer appearances in the manga, making it difficult for Akane to fully immerse herself in the role. Her struggles are compounded by differences between the play's script and the original work—differences that also frustrate Tokyo Blade's author, Abiko Samejima.\n\nAqua, however, is more concerned with his personal goals than he is with the play. He has only one objective in mind: to grow closer to director Toshirou Kindaichi and find out what he knows about Aqua's mother, Ai.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Three mighty walls—Wall Maria, Rose, and Sheena—provided peace and protection for humanity for over a hundred years. That peace, however, was shattered when the Colossal Titan and Armored Titan appeared and destroyed the outermost wall, Wall Maria. Forced to retreat behind Wall Rose, humanity waited with bated breath for the Titans to reappear and destroy their safe haven once more.\n\nIn Shingeki no Kyojin Season 2, Eren Yeager and others of the 104th Training Corps have just begun to become full members of the Survey Corps. As they ready themselves to face the Titans once again, their preparations are interrupted by the invasion of Wall Rose—but all is not as it seems as more mysteries are unraveled. As the Survey Corps races to save the wall, they uncover more about the invading Titans and the dark secrets of their own members.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
