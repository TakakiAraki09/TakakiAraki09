With a group of samurai now incessantly harassing her, Fuu desperately calls upon another samurai in the shop, Mugen, who quickly defeats them with his wild fighting technique, utilizing movements reminiscent to that of breakdancing. Unfortunately, Mugen decides to pick a fight with the unwilling ronin Jin, who wields a more precise and traditional style of swordfighting, and the latter proves to be a formidable opponent. The only problem is, they end up destroying the entire shop as well as accidentally killing the local magistrate's son.\n\nFor their crime, the two samurai are captured and set to be executed. However, they are rescued by Fuu, who hires the duo as her bodyguards. Though she no longer has a place to return to, the former waitress wishes to find a certain samurai who smells of sunflowers and enlists the help of the now exonerated pair to do so. Despite initially disapproving of this idea, the two eventually agree to assist the girl in her quest; thus, the trio embark upon an adventure to find this mysterious warrior—that is, if Fuu can keep Mugen and Jin from killing each other.\n\nSet in an alternate Edo Period of Japan, Samurai Champloo follows the journey of these three eccentric individuals in an epic quest full of action, comedy, and dynamic sword fighting, all set to the beat of a unique hip-hop infused soundtrack.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal Titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.\n\nAfter witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Eren, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman, and his childhood friend Armin Arlert join the brutal war against the Titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, an encounter with a mysterious man upends Rafal's life, sparking an illogical desire to instead pursue his passion for astronomy.\n\nRafal is determined to prove the beauty and rationality of heliocentrism—the theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun. This belief is considered heretical by the powerful Church, which promotes geocentrism—the Sun revolving around the Earth—as the sole truth of the universe. Those whose beliefs do not align with the will of the Church suffer unfathomably gruesome consequences.\n\nIn pursuit of evidence for a heliocentric model of the universe, Rafal grapples with obtaining precise calculations and building empirical theories. His greatest challenge, however, lies in conducting this research discreetly—lest he wish to meet the same fate as other heretics.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately, the 13 heroes dispatched to the southern region are easily wiped out by Clevatess, one of the Lords of Dark Beasts. Determined to get revenge against humanity, Clevatess bursts into the capital of the Kingdom of Hiden, leaving a trail of death and destruction behind him.\n\nAlthough the situation looks desperate, humanity still has a chance to appease Clevatess' anger. Alicia Glenfall, one of the 13 heroes, is revived by Clevatess to help him raise a newborn infant, Luna, whose choices shall shape the fate of the human world. Although reluctant to help the dark beast at first, Alicia understands that Luna is the only thing that stands between humanity and complete annihilation. \n\nHiding himself by taking on a human form, Clevatess sets out in search for a wet nurse with Alicia and Luna. With Clevatess unwilling to reveal his identity, it falls on Alicia to slay all enemies that stand in their way. Meanwhile, the neighboring countries prepare to advance on the weakened Hiden, aiming to control the only forge capable of producing the heroes' weapons.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The ingenious 17-year-old Japanese student Light Yagami and sadistic god of death Ryuk share one belief: their worlds are rotten.\n\nFor his own amusement, Ryuk drops his Death Note into the human world. Light stumbles upon it, deeming the first of its rules ridiculous: the human whose name is written in this note shall die. However, the temptation is too great, and Light experiments by writing a felon's name, which disturbingly enacts his first murder.\n\nAware of the terrifying godlike power that has fallen into his hands, Light—under the alias Kira—follows his wicked sense of justice with the ultimate goal of cleansing the world of all evil-doers. The meticulous mastermind detective L is already on his trail, but as Light's brilliance rivals L's, the grand chase for Kira turns into an intense battle of wits that can only end when one of them is dead.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n",

Following the conclusion of the third Grail War, a US-based organization with magi distinct from the London-based Mage Association, used data from Fuyuki's Grail War to plan their own ritual. Seventy years later, they used the city of Snowfield as the Sacred Land for their own Grail War. However, they were unable to successfully replicate every aspect of the ritual, resulting in it acting only as an imitation that has lost the Saber class and allowed for the summoning of strange Servants due to the blurring of the definition of a \"hero.\"\n\nRohngall and his pupil, Faldeus, have been dispatched by the Mage's Association to investigate the city and the state of the war. Faldeus, a US organization spy, has Rohngall sniped upon his arrival, despite knowing that Rohngall is a puppet. He declares that their Holy Grail War has been in development and is real, causing a commotion at the Clock Tower, and that he wishes to \"advertise\" the project to the Association.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

Among the four other crew members is a Gnosia: a Gnos infectee whose goal is the eradication of humanity. The Gnosia appears human in all other respects, so the uninfected have little choice but to vote on whom they suspect to be the enemy, hoping to neutralize the Gnosia by putting them into cold sleep. If the Gnosia survives the vote, they will eliminate one crew member during the cruiser's following warp, when only the Gnosia remains conscious.\n\nVoting quickly proves to be an unreliable strategy, and Yuuri is left one-on-one with the Gnosia. Just when all hope seems lost, time seemingly loops back to when Yuuri first awakened. With each time loop, however, conditions aboard the ship change—neither the size of the crew nor the members' identities remain constant. Trapped in both time and space, Yuuri must figure out how to escape the loops and save humanity from the Gnosia.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Light Underwood wishes for a powerful skill that would allow him to become an adventurer with his childhood friend Lena Floria. When the day of selection arrives, the excited boy regrettably acquires Fruitmaster, a skill which merely improves his cultivation of fruits. Even worse, he is separated from Lena when she obtains an exceptional ability.\n\nAlthough disappointed by the result, Light begins his life as a farmer and takes in a young girl named Ayla Lawrence. One day, due to a misunderstanding, the two consume Skill Fruits. However, instead of dying, Light miraculously receives a second skill, suited for combat, with his original ability. Now seemingly the only person who can gain multiple skills, Light wants to catch up to Lena and make history as the strongest adventurer.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately for him, skills of this nature are considered useless due to their low success rate, and Touka is thus assigned the title of E-rank hero. Things take a further turn for the worse when Vicius, the goddess who summoned the class, reveals that the lowest-ranked hero will be disposed of so that they do not hinder those with greater talent.\n\nBanished to a notoriously dangerous area, Touka comes face-to-face with death after being cornered by a minotaur-like creature. In a desperate attempt to survive, he uses his supposedly worthless skill—only to quickly realize that it works almost every time. Armed with the ability to render the monsters standing in his way completely helpless, Touka resolves to track down the goddess that tossed him aside and exact his revenge.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Finally, Sagiri Yamada Asaemon, a fledgling member of a famed executioner clan, is asked to take Gabimaru's life; yet Sagiri makes no move to kill him as requested.\n\nInsisting that Gabimaru will not die because of his love for his wife, Sagiri instead offers him the chance to obtain a full pardon for his crimes. If he can travel to the island of Shinsekyo and obtain the Elixir of Life—which supposedly grants immortality—and bring it back for the shogun, then his freedom will be assured.\n\nBut of the many who have traveled to Shinsekyo in search of the mythical Elixir, not a single person has returned sound of mind, if at all. Though unaware of the numerous dangers ahead, Gabimaru decides to accept the offer—alongside ten other death row convicts—in hope that he and his wife may finally live in peace.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Many have become astounding swordsmen themselves, but Beryl remains quite humble, referring to himself as an old man. His former disciples all disagree, including Allucia Citrus, a girl who graduated from Beryl's training over 10 years ago and is currently the commander of the Royal Order of Knights.\n\nWishing to reveal her cherished teacher's true greatness, Allucia recommends Beryl to her superiors, leading to his appointment as a special instructor for the Order by imperial command. She delivers the news herself—though Beryl has yet to realize her deeper motive. Pressured by his aging parents, Beryl reluctantly accepts the job and moves to the capital. There, he meets more of his past students, such as Surena Lysandra, now a black-rank adventurer, and Ficelle Harbeller, a prominent member of the Magic Corps. Before long, word begins to spread: not even the strongest warriors can match the \"old man\" from the countryside.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Moreover, when he enrolls at the academy to reclaim his rightful title, he finds out that demonkind remembers him differently.

As he sets out to uncover those altering his glorious past, he takes it upon himself to make his descendants recognize that their ruler has finally returned.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To combat the threat of the Shuuki and rescue victims like Yuuki, the all-female Demon Defense Force was established. Its members have been blessed with the power of \"Peaches\"—Mato fruits that grant supernatural abilities only to women.\n\nThough Yuuki's situation is dire, he is saved in the nick of time by Kyouka Uzen, the chief of the Demon Defense Force's seventh unit. Despite Kyouka's impeccable skills in battle, she has long been held back by her Peach-granted ability, Slave. Slave allows Kyouka to put a living being under her control and draw out its strength, but the Shuuki that she had enslaved until now had all proven to be exceedingly weak.\n\nWhen Yuuki and Kyouka become surrounded by a horde of Shuuki, Kyouka resorts to something she has never tried before: using her ability on a man. To her surprise, Yuuki's slave form is much more powerful than she could have imagined. Believing the young man to be the key to unlocking her true potential, Kyouka invites Yuuki to join the Demon Defense Force—but not as a regular member.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In the 22nd century, Japan enforces the Sibyl System, an objective means of determining the threat level of each citizen by examining their mental state for signs of criminal intent, known as their Psycho-Pass. Inspectors uphold the law by subjugating, often with lethal force, anyone harboring the slightest ill-will; alongside them are Enforcers, citizens that have become latent criminals, granted relative freedom in exchange for carrying out the Inspectors' dirty work.\n\nInto this world steps Akane Tsunemori, a young woman with an honest desire to uphold justice. However, as she works alongside veteran Enforcer Shinya Kougami, she soon learns that the Sibyl System's judgments are not as perfect as her fellow Inspectors assume. With everything she has known turned on its head, Akane wrestles with the question of what justice truly is, and whether it can be upheld through the use of a system that may already be corrupt.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Nonetheless, their days pass like any other, until a new transfer student arrives at their high school—one who bears a striking resemblance to an old enemy.\n\nYuuji and Shana have no time to dance around their feelings for each other; while their adversaries from the Bal Masqué organization plan their next attack, the two must keep their guard up as they explore the origin behind the coveted magical object within Yuuji's body, the \"Midnight Lost Child.\"\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The few who share his hobby might recognize him by his in-game name, Sunraku. For his next game, Rakurou is recommended Shangri-La Frontier, a popular and well-received virtual reality game as a breather from the terrible games he has been playing recently.\n\nOnce he boots up the game, Rakurou decides to sell off most of his starting gear to gain extra money, leaving himself with only a pair of boxers, a bird mask, and some weapons. He is instantly hooked as he meticulously levels up his avatar. However, after encountering some intimidating monsters, he realizes that he may have underestimated the challenge that a mainstream game can offer. As Rakurou progresses, he must draw on all the skills he has perfected from his previous gaming experience.

In the midst of a casual encounter with his colleague, he falls victim to a random assailant on the streets and is stabbed. However, while succumbing to his injuries, a peculiar voice echoes in his mind, and recites a bunch of commands which the dying man cannot make sense of.\n\nWhen Satoru regains consciousness, he discovers that he has reincarnated as a goop of slime in an unfamiliar realm. In doing so, he acquires newfound skills—notably, the power to devour anything and mimic its appearance and abilities. He then stumbles upon the sealed Catastrophe-level monster \"Storm Dragon\" Veldora who had been sealed away for the past 300 years for devastating a town to ashes. Sympathetic to his predicament, Satoru befriends him, promising to assist in destroying the seal. In return, Veldora bestows upon him the name Rimuru Tempest to grant him divine protection. \n\nNow, liberated from the mundanities of his past life, Rimuru embarks on a fresh journey with a distinct goal in mind. As he grows accustomed to his new physique, his gooey antics ripple throughout the world, gradually altering his fate.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Young Thorfinn grew up listening to the stories of old sailors that had traveled the ocean and reached the place of legend, Vinland. It's said to be warm and fertile, a place where there would be no need for fighting—not at all like the frozen village in Iceland where he was born, and certainly not like his current life as a mercenary. War is his home now. Though his father once told him, \"You have no enemies, nobody does. There is nobody who it's okay to hurt,\" as he grew, Thorfinn knew that nothing was further from the truth.\n\nThe war between England and the Danes grows worse with each passing year. Death has become commonplace, and the viking mercenaries are loving every moment of it. Allying with either side will cause a massive swing in the balance of power, and the vikings are happy to make names for themselves and take any spoils they earn along the way. Among the chaos, Thorfinn must take his revenge and kill Askeladd, the man who murdered his father. The only paradise for the vikings, it seems, is the era of war and death that rages on.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Due to the fanbase preferring Tsurugi as Touki's love interest, Saya has made fewer and fewer appearances in the manga, making it difficult for Akane to fully immerse herself in the role. Her struggles are compounded by differences between the play's script and the original work—differences that also frustrate Tokyo Blade's author, Abiko Samejima.\n\nAqua, however, is more concerned with his personal goals than he is with the play. He has only one objective in mind: to grow closer to director Toshirou Kindaichi and find out what he knows about Aqua's mother, Ai.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
