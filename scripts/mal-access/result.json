Assigned to a case involving false advertisement, Zen—along with his assistant officer, Atsuhiko Fumio—investigate Japan Supiri, a pharmaceutical company that had provided fabricated clinical research on the company's new drug. While investigating the file of Shin Inaba, an anesthesiologist connected to the crime, the case takes a dark turn when Zen finds a page stained with a mixture of blood, hair and skin, along with the letter \"F\" scribbled all across the sheet. As he investigates further, the case goes beyond Zen's imagination and becomes vastly complex, challenging his sense of justice and his knowledge of the truth. \n\nDigging deeper into the investigation, Zen begins to uncover a concealed plot behind the ongoing mayoral election and ties to many people of interest involved in the election and those closer than he thinks. The case grows more severe and propels Zen into an unforeseen hurricane of corruption and deceit behind the election, the establishment of the Shiniki district, and the mysterious woman associated with it all. \n\n[Written by MAL

To this end, he publicly states his intention to study theology—the academic field held in highest regard in early 15th century Poland. However, an encounter with a mysterious man upends Rafal's life, sparking an illogical desire to instead pursue his passion for astronomy.\n\nRafal is determined to prove the beauty and rationality of heliocentrism—the theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun. This belief is considered heretical by the powerful Church, which promotes geocentrism—the Sun revolving around the Earth—as the sole truth of the universe. Those whose beliefs do not align with the will of the Church suffer unfathomably gruesome consequences.\n\nIn pursuit of evidence for a heliocentric model of the universe, Rafal grapples with obtaining precise calculations and building empirical theories. His greatest challenge, however, lies in conducting this research discreetly—lest he wish to meet the same fate as other heretics.\n\n[Written by MAL

from the masses of ordinary humans. They might go as far as seeing themselves capable of wielding mystical powers, or maybe even believe themselves to have descended from a fantasy realm. This \"disease\" is known as \"chuunibyou\" and is often the source of some of the most embarrassing moments of a person's life.\n\nFor Yuuta Togashi, the scars that his chuunibyou has left behind are still fresh. Having posed as the \"Dark Flame Master\" during his middle school years, he looks back at those times with extreme embarrassment, so much so that he decides to attend a high school far away where nobody will recognize him. Putting his dark history behind him, he longs to live a normal high school life.\n\nUnfortunately, he hasn't escaped his past yet: enter Rikka Takanashi, Yuuta's new classmate and self-declared vessel of the \"Wicked Eye.\" As this eccentric young girl crashes into Yuuta's life, his dream of an ordinary, chuunibyou-free life quickly crumbles away. In this hilarious and heartwarming story of a boy who just wants to leave his embarrassing memories behind, the delusions of old are far from a thing of the past.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","mean":7.7,"rank":1350,"popularity":101,"num_list_users":1438633,"num_scoring_users":819705,"nsfw":"white","created_at":"2012-07-06T12:05:10Z","updated_at":"2024-05-03T11:39:59Z","media_type":"tv","status":"finished_airing","genres":[{"id":4,"name":"Comedy"},{"id":22,"name":"Romance"},{"id":23,"name":"School"}],"my_list_status":{"status":"completed","score":10,"num_episodes_watched":12,"is_rewatching":false,"updated_at":"2025-11-25T10:01:55Z","priority":0,"num_times_rewatched":0,"rewatch_value":0,"tags":null,"comments":"","start_date":"2025-11-25","finish_date":"2025-11-25"},"num_episodes":12,"start_season":{"year":2012,"season":"fall"},"broadcast":{"day_of_the_week":"thursday","start_time":"00:30"},"source":"light_novel","average_episode_duration":1440,"rating":"pg_13","pictures":[{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/40167.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/40167l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/43003.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/43003l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/46125.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/46125l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/46251.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/46251l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/46255.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/46255l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/46931.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/46931l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/72720.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/72720l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1905/142840.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1905/142840l.jpg"}],"background":"Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! won an honorable mention at the 2010 Kyoto Animation Awards. \n","related_anime":[{"node":{"id":15687,"title":"Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!

In contrast, the realm of death gods is a humdrum, unchanging gambling den. The ingenious 17-year-old Japanese student Light Yagami and sadistic god of death Ryuk share one belief: their worlds are rotten.\n\nFor his own amusement, Ryuk drops his Death Note into the human world. Light stumbles upon it, deeming the first of its rules ridiculous: the human whose name is written in this note shall die. However, the temptation is too great, and Light experiments by writing a felon's name, which disturbingly enacts his first murder.\n\nAware of the terrifying godlike power that has fallen into his hands, Light—under the alias Kira—follows his wicked sense of justice with the ultimate goal of cleansing the world of all evil-doers. The meticulous mastermind detective L is already on his trail, but as Light's brilliance rivals L's, the grand chase for Kira turns into an intense battle of wits that can only end when one of them is dead.\n\n[Written by MAL

a subterranean maze full of dangerous monsters and precarious traps. Through the use of advanced magic, an explorer can sometimes be resurrected, allowing them to learn from past mistakes and give traversing the dungeon another go. However, when a powerful dragon eats Falin, Laios' spellcasting sister, she sends her brother and his companions back to the beginning to save them from permanent ends.\n\nThough strapped for cash and equipment, Laios resolves to fight his way through the dungeon and rescue Falin before she can be digested by the dragon. Despite some of Laios' allies abandoning him, two remain by his side: elven mage Marcille Donato and halfling locksmith Chilchuck Tims. Due to their lack of funds, the party faces the daunting prospect of starving before being able to complete their quest. However, they find salvation in Senshi, a dwarven warrior with a penchant for cooking and safely eating defeated monsters.\n\nWith Senshi's culinary expertise, Laios and his companions struggle through the dungeon while learning about gourmet dining—and each other—along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL

man who hopes to become the greatest adventurer in the land. After a chance encounter with the lonely goddess, Hestia, his dreams become a little closer to reality. With her support, Bell embarks on a fantastic quest as he ventures deep within the city's monster-filled catacombs, known only as the \"Dungeon.\" Death lurks around every corner in the cavernous depths of this terrifying labyrinth, and a mysterious power moves amidst the shadows.\n\nEven on the surface, survival is a hard-earned privilege. Indeed, nothing is ever certain in a world where gods and humans live and work together, especially when they often struggle to get along. One thing is for sure, though: a myriad of blunders, triumphs and friendships awaits the dauntlessly optimistic protagonist of this herculean tale.\n\n[Written by MAL

Virus spread across Japan, bringing death to its citizens and plunging the country into utter chaos. In an effort to establish order, the United Nations sends the GHQ to assist with the crisis by containing the outbreak while removing all political autonomy in the process. A decade later, the country still lives under their control, unable to break free from their draconian rule.\n\nFrustrated with the state of the nation, a resistance group named the Funeral Parlor aims to liberate Japan from the GHQ. Led by the charismatic Gai Tsutsugami, the group plots to steal a vial containing the \"Void Genome\" to further their goals. The vial falls into the hands of internet vocalist Inori Yuzuriha, who ends up being hunted by the GHQ's Anti-Bodies forces. Having nowhere to go, she seeks refuge in a warehouse where she meets Shuu Ouma—a socially awkward high school student who is a huge fan of her music.\n\nShuu gets dragged into the conflict the moment he rescues Inori, and the Void Genome shatters in his hand, granting him the \"Power of the Kings.\" While learning how to control his grand new ability, Shuu must now fight to liberate Japan from its cruel oppressors.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n","mean":7.39,"rank":2523,"popularity":121,"num_list_users":1266068,"num_scoring_users":658161,"nsfw":"white","created_at":"2011-06-08T21:16:25Z","updated_at":"2025-10-17T21:40:33Z","media_type":"tv","status":"finished_airing","genres":[{"id":8,"name":"Drama"},{"id":18,"name":"Mecha"},{"id":24,"name":"Sci-Fi"},{"id":31,"name":"Super Power"}],"my_list_status":{"status":"completed","score":10,"num_episodes_watched":22,"is_rewatching":false,"updated_at":"2025-11-25T10:02:18Z","priority":0,"num_times_rewatched":0,"rewatch_value":0,"tags":null,"comments":"","start_date":"2025-11-25","finish_date":"2025-11-25"},"num_episodes":22,"start_season":{"year":2011,"season":"fall"},"broadcast":{"day_of_the_week":"friday","start_time":"01:15"},"source":"original","average_episode_duration":1440,"rating":"r","pictures":[{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/30863.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/30863l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/32233.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/32233l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/32237.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/32237l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/41705.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/41705l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/44241.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/44241l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/73136.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/73136l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1085/93983.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1085/93983l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1566/133912.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1566/133912l.jpg"}],"background":"The first two episodes of Guilty Crown were screened at the New York Anime Festival on October 15, 2011.

Since Kaiji has little money and no future prospects of his own, he is unable to return what his colleague borrowed. Faced with massive financial burdens, Kaiji is given an offer to board the illustrious Espoir—it is said that \"one night aboard the ship, and all of your debts will be paid.\"\n\nWhat seems like a simple night of gambling quickly turns into a game of strategy and betrayal. With the losers of the tournament being subjected to a backbreaking life of indebted servitude, Kaiji must choose his actions—and allies—carefully. However, this is only the beginning of a series of gambles that will wager Kaiji's life, testing the full extent of his wits and will to survive.\n\n[Written by MAL

Mimori is summoned to another world alongside his classmates, he obtains the power to inflict status ailments, such as paralysis or poison, on his enemies. Unfortunately for him, skills of this nature are considered useless due to their low success rate, and Touka is thus assigned the title of E-rank hero. Things take a further turn for the worse when Vicius, the goddess who summoned the class, reveals that the lowest-ranked hero will be disposed of so that they do not hinder those with greater talent.\n\nBanished to a notoriously dangerous area, Touka comes face-to-face with death after being cornered by a minotaur-like creature. In a desperate attempt to survive, he uses his supposedly worthless skill—only to quickly realize that it works almost every time. Armed with the ability to render the monsters standing in his way completely helpless, Touka resolves to track down the goddess that tossed him aside and exact his revenge.\n\n[Written by MAL

traversing the world's uncharted territories to locating rare items and monsters. Before becoming a Hunter, one must pass the Hunter Examination—a high-risk selection process in which most applicants end up handicapped or worse, deceased.\n\nAmbitious participants who challenge the notorious exam carry their own reason. What drives 12-year-old Gon Freecss is finding Ging, his father and a Hunter himself. Believing that he will meet his father by becoming a Hunter, Gon takes the first step to walk the same path.\n\nDuring the Hunter Examination, Gon befriends the medical student Leorio Paladiknight, the vindictive Kurapika, and ex-assassin Killua Zoldyck. While their motives vastly differ from each other, they band together for a common goal and begin to venture into a perilous world.\n\n[Written by MAL

Despite growing up poor, a pragmatic young man, Zenos, taught himself everything about healing. As an exceptional healer, Zenos was even recruited by an adventurer party but eventually kicked out. When he meets and helps an elf slave named Lily, he realizes his new ambition: he wants to open a clinic in the shadows, serving those who may otherwise be cast aside.\n\nZenos starts his underground practice alongside Lily, but he is immediately pulled into a conflict between lizardmen, werewolves, and orcs—which he quickly resolves and unites the races, thanks to his healing abilities. However, when the royal knights hear rumors of his recent accomplishments and are less than pleased, Zenos must find a way to continue his operations without compromising his principles.\n\n[Written

the small city into complete chaos. Thankfully, for the students of Doumori Elementary School, new teacher and exorcist Meisuke \"Nube\" Nueno is determined to prevent the malignant spirits—known as youkai—from accomplishing their evil deeds.\n\nThe first student who catches Nube's attention is transfer student Hiroshi Tateno, who displays inexplicable outbursts of anger, often lashing out at his classmates.

After leading a blood-soaked life, Gabimaru believes he deserves to die. However, every attempt to execute him inexplicably fails. Finally, Sagiri Yamada Asaemon, a fledgling member of a famed executioner clan, is asked to take Gabimaru's life; yet Sagiri makes no move to kill him as requested.\n\nInsisting that Gabimaru will not die because of his love for his wife, Sagiri instead offers him the chance to obtain a full pardon for his crimes. If he can travel to the island of Shinsekyo and obtain the Elixir of Life—which supposedly grants immortality—and bring it back for the shogun, then his freedom will be assured.\n\nBut of the many who have traveled to Shinsekyo in search of the mythical Elixir, not a single person has returned sound of mind, if at all. Though unaware of the numerous dangers ahead, Gabimaru decides to accept the offer—alongside ten other death row convicts—in hope that he and his wife may finally live in peace.\n\n[Written by MAL

being rescued from a carriage incident. What the Joestars don't realize, however, is that Dario had no intention of helping them; he believed they were dead and was trying to ransack their belongings. After Dario's death 12 years later, George—hoping to repay his debt—adopts his son, Dio. \n\nWhile he publicly fawns over his new father, Dio secretly plans to steal the Joestar fortune. His first step is to create a divide between George and Jonathan. By constantly outdoing his foster brother, Dio firmly makes his place in the Joestar family. But when Dio pushes Jonathan too far, Jonathan defeats him in a brawl. \n\nYears later, the two appear to be close friends to the outside world. But trouble brews again when George falls ill, as Jonathan suspects that Dio is somehow behind the incident—and it appears he has more tricks up his sleeve.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","mean":7.87,"rank":923,"popularity":60,"num_list_users":1806325,"num_scoring_users":1164347,"nsfw":"white","created_at":"2012-07-05T06:49:13Z","updated_at":"2024-11-03T13:58:15Z","media_type":"tv","status":"finished_airing","genres":[{"id":1,"name":"Action"},{"id":2,"name":"Adventure"},{"id":13,"name":"Historical"},{"id":27,"name":"Shounen"},{"id":37,"name":"Supernatural"},{"id":32,"name":"Vampire"}],"my_list_status":{"status":"completed","score":10,"num_episodes_watched":26,"is_rewatching":false,"updated_at":"2025-11-14T03:32:59Z","priority":0,"num_times_rewatched":0,"rewatch_value":0,"tags":null,"comments":"","start_date":"","finish_date":""},"num_episodes":26,"start_season":{"year":2012,"season":"fall"},"broadcast":{"day_of_the_week":"saturday","start_time":"00:30"},"source":"manga","average_episode_duration":1440,"rating":"r","pictures":[{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/40409.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/40409l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/42707.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/42707l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/44177.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/44177l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/71542.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/71542l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1453/96724.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1453/96724l.jpg"}],"background":"JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken was announced on July 5, 2012 at a press conference celebrating the 25th anniversary Hirohiko Araki's long-running series.

jail cell. He's committed no crime yet demands he not be released, believing he's been possessed by an evil spirit capable of harming those around him. Concerned for her son, Holy Kuujou asks her father, Joseph Joestar, to convince Joutarou to leave the prison. Joseph informs his grandson that the \"evil spirit\" is in fact something called a \"Stand,\" the physical manifestation of one's fighting spirit which can adopt a variety of deadly forms.

rampant around the youth, and the mafia governs the streets with an iron fist. However, various fateful encounters will soon occur.\n\nEnter Giorno Giovanna, a 15-year-old boy with an eccentric connection to the Joestar family, who makes a living out of part-time jobs and pickpocketing. Furthermore, he is gifted with the unexplained Stand ability to give and create life—growing plants from the ground and turning inanimate objects into live animals, an ability he has dubbed \"Gold Experience.\" Fascinated by the might of local gangsters, Giorno has dreamed of rising up in their ranks and becoming a \"Gang-Star,\" a feat made possible by his encounter with Bruno Bucciarati, a member of the Passione gang with his own sense of justice.\n\nJoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Ougon no Kaze follows the endeavors of Giorno after joining Bruno's team while working under Passione, fending off other gangsters and secretly plotting to overthrow their mysterious boss.\n\n[Written by MAL

intense debate between two inseparable best friends. Exuding unshakeable confidence, Satoru Gojou and Suguru Getou believe there is no challenge too great for young and powerful Special Grade sorcerers such as themselves. They are tasked with safely delivering a sensible girl named Riko Amanai to the entity whose existence is the very essence of the jujutsu world. However, the mission plunges them into an exhausting swirl of moral conflict that threatens to destroy the already feeble amity between sorcerers and ordinary humans.\n\nTwelve years later, students and sorcerers are the frontline defense against the rising number of high-level curses born from humans' negative emotions. As the entities grow in power, their self-awareness and ambition increase too. The curses unite for the common goal of eradicating humans and creating a world of only cursed energy users, led by a dangerous, ancient cursed spirit. To dispose of their greatest obstacle—the strongest sorcerer, Gojou—they orchestrate an attack at Shibuya Station on Halloween. Dividing into teams, the sorcerers enter the fight prepared to risk everything to protect the innocent and their own kind.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","mean":8.72,"rank":52,"popularity":118,"num_list_users":1282330,"num_scoring_users":742136,"nsfw":"white","created_at":"2022-02-12T10:05:19Z","updated_at":"2024-10-02T16:17:11Z","media_type":"tv","status":"finished_airing","genres":[{"id":1,"name":"Action"},{"id":58,"name":"Gore"},{"id":23,"name":"School"},{"id":27,"name":"Shounen"},{"id":37,"name":"Supernatural"}],"my_list_status":{"status":"completed","score":6,"num_episodes_watched":23,"is_rewatching":false,"updated_at":"2025-11-04T08:45:08Z","priority":0,"num_times_rewatched":0,"rewatch_value":0,"tags":null,"comments":"","start_date":"","finish_date":""},"num_episodes":23,"start_season":{"year":2023,"season":"summer"},"broadcast":{"day_of_the_week":"thursday","start_time":"23:56"},"source":"manga","average_episode_duration":1435,"rating":"r","pictures":[{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1168/128144.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1168/128144l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1676/128448.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1676/128448l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1600/134703.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1600/134703l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1792/138022.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1792/138022l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1732/139397.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1732/139397l.jpg"}],"background":"Jujutsu Kaisen 2nd Season was released on Blu-ray and DVD in eight volumes from October 18, 2023, to May 22, 2024.

and Mina Ashiro make a pact to become officers in the Defense Force—a militarized organization tasked with protecting Japan from colossal monsters known as \"kaijuu.\" Decades later, the 32-year-old Kafka has all but given up on his dreams of heroism. Instead, he cleans up the remains of the slaughtered kaijuu after they are defeated by valiant soldiers—including Mina, who has successfully achieved their shared goal.\n\nUpon meeting his new coworker, Reno Ichikawa, Kafka faces a mirror of his past self: an ambitious young man whose one desire is to fight as a member of the Defense Force. Unfortunately, the two are soon involved in a freak encounter with a rogue kaijuu. Though Kafka demonstrates his innate heroic nature and rescues Reno from certain doom, he is left gravely injured.\n\nWhile both men recover in a hospital, Kafka is seemingly attacked by another one of the beasts. As a result, he gains the ability to transform into a humanoid kaijuu with the strength and powers of the massive monsters menacing Japan. Dubbed \"Kaijuu No. 8\" by the military, Kafka resolves to use his newfound gifts for the greater good. Tied together by mutual respect, Kafka and Reno set out to join warriors like Mina at the forefront of the Defense Force.\n\n[Written by MAL

of recent recruit Kafka Hibino, otherwise known as Kaijuu No. 8, the Defense Force has been puzzled by how to deal with him. Kafka is the first kaijuu to side with humans, and after careful consideration, he is eventually transferred to the Defense Force's First Division in the hope of adding his power to the strongest division, capable of handling any threat. However, some people are still doubtful about Kafka, and he must prove his worth in the next mission.\n\nKafka and the First Division are soon dispatched when a massive horde of ant-like kaijuu begins wreaking havoc. Thanks to the combined strength of Kafka's friend Kikoru Shinomiya and their captain, Gen Narumi, the mission seems to progress as it should. However, when Kafka fails to transform into his kaijuu form, the dreadful Kaijuu No. 9 joins the battle with only one goal—to eliminate him and steal his power. Although the situation is looking grim, Kafka must overcome his most difficult trial yet with the others if he wants to keep pursuing his dream: fighting side by side with his childhood friend and Third Division captain, Mina Ashiro.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","mean":7.8,"rank":1089,"popularity":877,"num_list_users":312335,"num_scoring_users":124197,"nsfw":"white","created_at":"2024-06-29T14:28:08Z","updated_at":"2025-09-01T01:55:51Z","media_type":"tv","status":"finished_airing","genres":[{"id":1,"name":"Action"},{"id":50,"name":"Adult Cast"},{"id":10,"name":"Fantasy"},{"id":38,"name":"Military"},{"id":24,"name":"Sci-Fi"},{"id":27,"name":"Shounen"},{"id":82,"name":"Urban Fantasy"}],"my_list_status":{"status":"completed","score":8,"num_episodes_watched":11,"is_rewatching":false,"updated_at":"2025-11-25T10:01:06Z","priority":0,"num_times_rewatched":0,"rewatch_value":0,"tags":null,"comments":"","start_date":"2025-11-25","finish_date":"2025-11-25"},"num_episodes":11,"start_season":{"year":2025,"season":"summer"},"broadcast":{"day_of_the_week":"saturday","start_time":"23:00"},"source":"manga","average_episode_duration":1420,"rating":"pg_13","pictures":[{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1049/147109.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1049/147109l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1931/147440.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1931/147440l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1177/150344.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1177/150344l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1443/150461.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1443/150461l.jpg"}],"background":"","related_anime":[{"node":{"id":52588,"title":"Kaijuu 8-gou","main_picture":{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1370/140362.webp","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1370/140362l.webp"},"alternative_titles":{"synonyms":null,"en":"","ja":""},"start_date":"","end_date":"","synopsis":"","mean":0,"rank":0,"popularity":0,"num_list_users":0,"num_scoring_users":0,"nsfw":"","created_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","updated_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","media_type":"","status":"","genres":null,"my_list_status":{"status":"","score":0,"num_episodes_watched":0,"is_rewatching":false,"updated_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","priority":0,"num_times_rewatched":0,"rewatch_value":0,"tags":null,"comments":"","start_date":"","finish_date":""},"num_episodes":0,"start_season":{"year":0,"season":""},"broadcast":{"day_of_the_week":"","start_time":""},"source":"","average_episode_duration":0,"rating":"","pictures":null,"background":"","related_anime":null,"related_manga":null,"recommendations":null,"studios":null,"statistics":{"status":{"watching":"","completed":"","on_hold":"","dropped":"","plan_to_watch":""},"num_list_users":0}},"relation_type":"prequel","relation_type_formatted":"Prequel"}],"related_manga":[],"recommendations":[],"studios":[{"id":10,"name":"Production I.G"}],"statistics":{"status":{"watching":"","completed":"","on_hold":"","dropped":"","plan_to_watch":""},"num_list_users":0}},{"id":59452,"title":"Katainaka no Ossan, Kensei ni Naru","main_picture":{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1069/148148.webp","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1069/148148l.webp"},"alternative_titles":{"synonyms":[],"en":"From Old Country Bumpkin to Master Swordsman","ja":"片田舎のおっさん、剣聖になる"},"start_date":"2025-04-05","end_date":"2025-06-22","synopsis":"For 20 years, Beryl Gardenant has taught various people as the master of his father's sword-fighting dojo in a backwater village. Many have become astounding swordsmen themselves, but Beryl remains quite humble, referring to himself as an old man. His former disciples all disagree, including Allucia Citrus, a girl who graduated from Beryl's training over 10 years ago and is currently the commander of the Royal Order of Knights.\n\nWishing to reveal her cherished teacher's true greatness, Allucia recommends Beryl to her superiors, leading to his appointment as a special instructor for the Order by imperial command.

Hideki Nogi, a member of the Nogi Group, hires Ouma to fight for him and makes Kazuo Yamashita, an average middle-aged man, his manager. The duo is thrown into fights facilitated by the Kengan Association. Their journey will be full of ruthless battles with other fighters aiming for the same goal.

These insatiable beings acquire full control of their host and are able to morph into a variety of forms in order to feed on unsuspecting prey.\n \nSixteen-year-old high school student Shinichi Izumi falls victim to one of these parasites, but it fails to take over his brain, ending up in his right hand instead.

laughable and pathetic death on his way back from buying a game, high school student and recluse Kazuma Satou finds himself sitting before a beautiful but obnoxious goddess named Aqua. She provides the NEET with two options: continue on to heaven or reincarnate in every gamer's dream—a real fantasy world! Choosing to start a new life, Kazuma is quickly tasked with defeating a Demon King who is terrorizing villages. But before he goes, he can choose one item of any kind to aid him in his quest, and the future hero selects Aqua. But Kazuma has made a grave mistake—Aqua is completely useless!\n\nUnfortunately, their troubles don't end here; it turns out that living in such a world is far different from how it plays out in a game. Instead of going on a thrilling adventure, the duo must first work to pay for their living expenses. Indeed, their misfortunes have only just begun!\n\n[Written by MAL

plucked from her peaceful life and sold to the lowest echelons of the imperial court. Now merely a maid, Maomao settles into her new mundane life and hides her extensive knowledge of medicine in order to avoid any unwanted attention.\n\nNot long after Maomao's arrival, the emperor's infant children inexplicably begin to experience grave symptoms—almost as if a curse has been cast. The curious Maomao easily solves the mystery and, to remain out of the limelight, attempts to leave an anonymous tip. Unfortunately, the dashing and perceptive eunuch Jinshi sees through it and manages to single her out.\n\nIn recognition of her talent, Maomao is promoted to lady-in-waiting for the emperor's favorite concubine, Gyokuyou. As Maomao continues to remedy the numerous ailments afflicting the imperial court, her pharmaceutical expertise quickly proves indispensable.\n\n[Written by MAL

Having recently come to terms with the secrets of her parents, she returns to fulfill her normal duties on behalf of the emperor's highest-ranking consorts. Maomao also works alongside the eunuch Jinshi to better the consorts' many ladies-in-waiting, including helping them learn to read.\n\nHowever, with the arrival of a merchant caravan comes a new wave of intrigue. A pattern of strange coincidences involving the visitors and their wares unsettles Maomao, driving her to investigate the puzzling circumstances behind the convoy. As dangers from both outside and within threaten the balance between the imperial concubines, Maomao continues to utilize her cunning and medical expertise to keep the women safe from harm.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","mean":8.91,"rank":21,"popularity":608,"num_list_users":425650,"num_scoring_users":205984,"nsfw":"white","created_at":"2024-03-23T17:15:49Z","updated_at":"2025-06-13T09:05:01Z","media_type":"tv","status":"finished_airing","genres":[{"id":8,"name":"Drama"},{"id":13,"name":"Historical"},{"id":67,"name":"Medical"},{"id":7,"name":"Mystery"}],"my_list_status":{"status":"completed","score":9,"num_episodes_watched":24,"is_rewatching":false,"updated_at":"2025-11-25T09:53:36Z","priority":0,"num_times_rewatched":0,"rewatch_value":0,"tags":null,"comments":"","start_date":"2025-11-25","finish_date":"2025-11-25"},"num_episodes":24,"start_season":{"year":2025,"season":"winter"},"broadcast":{"day_of_the_week":"friday","start_time":"23:00"},"source":"light_novel","average_episode_duration":1440,"rating":"pg_13","pictures":[{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1838/142240.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1838/142240l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1378/144141.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1378/144141l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1681/144365.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1681/144365l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1252/145690.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1252/145690l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1377/146200.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1377/146200l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1751/147285.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1751/147285l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1852/147307.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1852/147307l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1075/147308.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1075/147308l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1025/147458.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1025/147458l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1074/147628.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1074/147628l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1172/147996.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1172/147996l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1120/148876.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1120/148876l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1245/149393.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1245/149393l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1432/149891.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1432/149891l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1005/150569.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1005/150569l.jpg"}],"background":"Kusuriya no Hitorigoto 2nd Season aired on Nippon TV's Friday Anime Night block.

the year 2048, Dr. Deniz Skinner, a scientific genius dubbed second only to Einstein, developed the revolutionary painkiller Hapna. Being cheap with no reported side effects, the drug gained widespread acceptance, even though Skinner himself silently vanished one year after launching the drug. Everyone revelled in the heaven of relief and ecstasy provided by Hapna, but they would suddenly come crashing down to Earth. It is now 2052, and Skinner reappears, giving the shocking announcement that Hapna was designed to mutate into a lethal toxin, killing anyone who had consumed it. While he claims to have a cure, he will only hand it over if he is physically found within 30 days. \n\nAxel Gilberto, a maverick youngster serving a sentence of 888 years in a high-security prison, is unwillingly recruited by a group calling themselves Lazarus. Composed of eccentric misfits, the group has only one task—to find Skinner. With no means to escape and their lives on the line, Lazarus begins the hunt to find Skinner before the countdown to the end of humanity ends.\n\n[Written by MAL

Fujino may only be in the fourth grade, but she already basks in high praise for her hand-drawn four-panel comics featured in the school's newspaper. However, when she is asked to share the page with Kyoumoto—a reclusive student she has never met—Fujino feels inadequate for the first time: her free-spirited drawings look embarrassingly amateurish next to Kyoumoto's breathtakingly detailed art.\n\nFor a year, Fujino shuts out the world, obsessively studying manga creation and drawing tirelessly to catch up to her faceless competition. But Kyoumoto's talent far exceeds hers, and Fujino quits it all. Another year passes, and on the day of their graduation, Fujino finally meets Kyoumoto. This unkempt, shy, and stuttering girl has actually been Fujino's biggest fan all along. Their encounter reignites Fujino's passion for art and sparks the beginning of a years-long friendship built on rivalry, admiration, and their shared love of manga.\n\n[Written by MAL

To put an end to this seemingly endless conflict, Demon King Anos Voldigoad willingly sacrificed his life, hoping to be reborn in a peaceful future.\n\nIn preparation for their king's return, the demon race created the Demon King Academy, an elite institution tasked with determining Anos' identity when he reawakens. He reincarnates two millennia later, but to his surprise, he soon learns that the level of magic in the world has drastically waned during his absence. Moreover, when he enrolls at the academy to reclaim his rightful title, he finds out that demonkind remembers him differently. His personality, his deeds, and even his legacy are all falsified—masked beneath the name of an impostor. This \"lack\" of common knowledge renders him the academy's outlier—a misfit never before seen in history.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, Anos remains unfazed. As he sets out to uncover those altering his glorious past, he takes it upon himself to make his descendants recognize that their ruler has finally returned.\n\n[Written by MAL

on their face. Those unable to practice magic are swiftly exterminated to maintain the magical integrity of society. However, deep within a forest lies an anomaly in Mash Burnedead, who can be found pumping iron with one arm and lifting a cream puff with the other. This aloof boy with superhuman strength—but no magical abilities—leads a quiet life with his father, far removed from society.\n\nMash's peace is soon disturbed when the authorities discover his lack of magical powers. They issue him an ultimatum: compete to become a Divine Visionary, which would force everyone to accept him, or be persecuted forever. To protect his family, he enrolls in the prestigious Easton Magic Academy, which only the most elite and gifted students are allowed to attend. Now, Mash must overcome his shortcomings as a magic-less being and surpass the other students—relying solely on his muscles.\n\n[Written by MAL

something heroic—only for it to end in a tragic accident. But in a twist of fate, he awakens in another world as Rudeus Greyrat, starting life again as a baby born to two loving parents.\n\nPreserving his memories and knowledge from his previous life, Rudeus quickly adapts to his new environment. With the mind of a grown adult, he starts to display magical talent that exceeds all expectations, honing his skill with the help of a mage named Roxy Migurdia. Rudeus learns swordplay from his father, Paul, and meets Sylphiette, a girl his age who quickly becomes his closest friend.\n\nAs Rudeus' second chance at life begins, he tries to make the most of his new opportunity while conquering his traumatic past. And perhaps, one day, he may find the one thing he could not find in his old world—love.\n\n[Written by MAL

There, they team up with their newfound companion Ruijerd Supardia—the former leader of the Superd's Warrior group—to form \"Dead End,\" a successful adventurer party. Making a name for themselves, the trio journeys across the continent to make their way back home to Fittoa.\n\nFollowing the advice he received from the faceless god Hitogami, Rudeus saves Kishirika Kishirisu, the Great Emperor of the Demon World, who rewards him by granting him a strange power. Now, as Rudeus masters the powerful ability that offers a number of new opportunities, it might prove to be more than what he bargained for when unexpected dangers threaten to hinder their

ago when the first gates—portals linked with other dimensions that harbor monsters immune to conventional weaponry—emerged around the world. Alongside the appearance of the gates, various humans were transformed into hunters and bestowed superhuman abilities. Responsible for entering the gates and clearing the dungeons within, many hunters chose to form guilds to secure their livelihoods.\n\nSung Jin-Woo is an E-rank hunter dubbed as the weakest hunter of all mankind. While exploring a supposedly safe dungeon, he and his party encounter an unusual tunnel leading to a deeper area. Enticed by the prospect of treasure, the group presses forward, only to be confronted with horrors beyond their imagination. Miraculously, Jin-Woo survives the incident and soon finds that he now has access to an interface visible only to him. This mysterious system promises him the power he has long dreamed of—but everything comes at a price.\n\n[Written by MAL

Once a prosperous city known for its trade, it now faces a crisis due to its caution—or even fear—of its king, Ainz Ooal Gown. To make amends, Ainz sends Albedo to the city as a diplomatic envoy.\n\nMeanwhile, the cardinals of the Slane Theocracy discuss how to retaliate against Ainz after his attack crippled the Re-Estize Kingdom's army, plotting for the Baharuth Empire to take over the Sorcerer Kingdom. However, when Emperor Jircniv Rune Farlord El Nix arranges a meeting with the Theocracy's messengers at a colosseum, he is confronted by none other than Ainz himself.\n\nWith their secret gathering now out in the open, the emperor and his guests learn that Ainz has challenged the Warrior King, the empire's greatest fighter, to a duel. With Ainz's motivations beyond his comprehension, Jircniv can do nothing but watch as humanity's future changes before his very eyes.\n\n[Written by MAL

and the enforcement of it, has changed. In the 22nd century, Japan enforces the Sibyl System, an objective means of determining the threat level of each citizen by examining their mental state for signs of criminal intent, known as their Psycho-Pass. Inspectors uphold the law by subjugating, often with lethal force, anyone harboring the slightest ill-will; alongside them are Enforcers, jaded Inspectors that have become latent criminals, granted relative freedom in exchange for carrying out the Inspectors' dirty work.\n\nInto this world steps Akane Tsunemori, a young woman with an honest desire to uphold justice. However, as she works alongside veteran Enforcer Shinya Kougami, she soon learns that the Sibyl System's judgments are not as perfect as her fellow Inspectors assume. With everything she has known turned on its head, Akane wrestles with the question of what justice truly is, and whether it can be upheld through the use of a system that may already be corrupt.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","mean":8.33,"rank":271,"popularity":70,"num_list_users":1725006,"num_scoring_users":821351,"nsfw":"white","created_at":"2012-03-30T12:22:25Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T14:08:28Z","media_type":"tv","status":"finished_airing","genres":[{"id":1,"name":"Action"},{"id":50,"name":"Adult Cast"},{"id":39,"name":"Detective"},{"id":7,"name":"Mystery"},{"id":40,"name":"Psychological"},{"id":24,"name":"Sci-Fi"},{"id":41,"name":"Suspense"}],"my_list_status":{"status":"completed","score":10,"num_episodes_watched":22,"is_rewatching":false,"updated_at":"2025-11-04T08:42:55Z","priority":0,"num_times_rewatched":0,"rewatch_value":0,"tags":null,"comments":"","start_date":"","finish_date":""},"num_episodes":22,"start_season":{"year":2012,"season":"fall"},"broadcast":{"day_of_the_week":"friday","start_time":"00:45"},"source":"original","average_episode_duration":1380,"rating":"r","pictures":[{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/43399.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/43399l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/44630.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/44630l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/45408.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/45408l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/74097.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/74097l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/74208.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/74208l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/74458.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/74458l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1041/96298.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1041/96298l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1340/100118.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1340/100118l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1291/134060.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1291/134060l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1255/136390.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1255/136390l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1469/136391.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1469/136391l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1314/142015.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1314/142015l.jpg"}],"background":"An edited version of the series received a rebroadcast starting July 10, 2014. 22 episodes of the original series were combined into eleven 46-minute long episodes with some scenes being slightly extended. \n\nPsycho-Pass aired on Fuji Television's noitaminA block.

original sci-fi psychological thriller, Akane Tsunemori continues her work as an inspector—enforcing the Sibyl System's judgments. Joining her are new enforcers and junior inspector Mika Shimotsuki, a young woman blindly and inflexibly loyal to Sibyl. As Akane ponders both the nature of her job and the legitimacy of Sibyl's verdicts, a disturbing new menace emerges.\n\nA mysterious figure has discovered a way to control the Crime Coefficient—a number compiled from mental scans that allows Sibyl to gauge psychological health and identify potential criminals. Through these means, he is able to murder an enforcer, leaving behind a cryptic clue: \"WC?\" scrawled in blood on a wall.\n\nAkane and the rest of Division 01 soon find themselves playing a deadly game against their new foe, coming face-to-face with a conspiracy threatening not only the authority of the Sibyl System, but the very foundation of Akane's own convictions.\n\n[Written by MAL

leaves the convenience store, the last thing he expects is to be wrenched from his everyday life and dropped into a fantasy world. Things are not looking good for the bewildered teenager; however, not long after his arrival, he is attacked by some thugs. Armed with only a bag of groceries and a now useless cell phone, he is quickly beaten to a pulp. Fortunately, a mysterious beauty named Satella, in hot pursuit after the one who stole her insignia, happens upon Subaru and saves him. In order to thank the honest and kindhearted girl, Subaru offers to help in her search, and later that night, he even finds the whereabouts of that which she seeks. But unbeknownst to them, a much darker force stalks the pair from the shadows, and just minutes after locating the insignia, Subaru and Satella are brutally murdered.\n\nHowever, Subaru immediately reawakens to a familiar scene—confronted by the same group of thugs, meeting Satella all over again—the enigma deepens as history inexplicably repeats itself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","mean":8.24,"rank":360,"popularity":23,"num_list_users":2396034,"num_scoring_users":1529311,"nsfw":"white","created_at":"2015-07-13T23:58:43Z","updated_at":"2025-06-13T08:29:15Z","media_type":"tv","status":"finished_airing","genres":[{"id":8,"name":"Drama"},{"id":10,"name":"Fantasy"},{"id":62,"name":"Isekai"},{"id":40,"name":"Psychological"},{"id":41,"name":"Suspense"},{"id":78,"name":"Time Travel"}],"my_list_status":{"status":"completed","score":9,"num_episodes_watched":25,"is_rewatching":false,"updated_at":"2025-11-14T03:28:35Z","priority":0,"num_times_rewatched":0,"rewatch_value":0,"tags":null,"comments":"","start_date":"","finish_date":""},"num_episodes":25,"start_season":{"year":2016,"season":"spring"},"broadcast":{"day_of_the_week":"monday","start_time":"01:05"},"source":"light_novel","average_episode_duration":1584,"rating":"r","pictures":[{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/75155.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/75155l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/76191.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/76191l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1522/128039.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1522/128039l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1534/134863.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1534/134863l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1269/151932.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1269/151932l.jpg"}],"background":"Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu adapts the first nine volumes of Tappei Nagatsuki's light novel series of the same title. \n\nAn edited version of the series, titled Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu: Shin Henshuu-ban (Re: Zero -Starting Life In Another World- Director's Cut), received a rebroadcast starting January 1, 2020.

One day, the great spirit Puck helps a young girl break out of her ice prison. Her name is Emilia, a half-elf born with silver hair, long ears, and amethyst eyes—features that resemble the evil Witch who destroyed half the world long ago. \n\nShunned by society because of her appearance, Emilia dwells in the forest with Puck as her sole companion and family. Burdened with a sin of destruction she does not remember committing, she spends her days trying to find a way to help her frozen kin. But when the great spirit Melakuera, the Arbitrator of the world, finds Emilia, her right to stay alive is brought into question.

No other professional hitman matched his prowess, and fellow assassins revered him. However, Sakamoto fell in love. In five short years, he married, became a father, put on some weight, and traded his weapons for an apron as he became the owner of a humble convenience store.\n\nAlthough Sakamoto is decidedly retired, he finds his old life of crime hard to shake off. His former partner, Shin Asakura, reappears and resolves to stay with Sakamoto's family under their strict no-kill rule. To make matters worse, a large bounty is placed on Sakamoto's head. Numerous assassins now pursue him—but they are in for a surprise. Sakamoto has not lost his edge, and no matter what tricks his enemies pull, he will fight off every last one to protect his dear family.\n\n[Written by MAL

The situation escalates even further when the Order, a group of the most skilled Japanese assassins, becomes involved.

The few who share his hobby might recognize him by his in-game name, Sunraku. For his next game, Rakurou is recommended Shangri-La Frontier, a popular and well-received virtual reality game as a breather from the terrible games he has been playing recently.\n\nOnce he boots up the game, Rakurou decides to sell off most of his starting gear to gain extra money, leaving himself with only a pair of boxers, a bird mask, and some weapons. He is instantly hooked as he meticulously levels up his avatar.

truly fallen in love with it. Sunraku has quickly made a big name for himself by fighting two of the seven unique, nearly unbeatable monsters, which is unthinkable for most players. To progress the game's story, he sets out on an adventure with his leporine guide, Emul, to acquire a magic operation unit from an ancient workshop.\n\nThough Sunraku breezes through this quest alongside his clanmates Towa \"Arthur Pencilgon\" Amane and Kei \"OiKatzo\" Uomi, there seems to be an ulterior motive as to why the two of them decided to help Sunraku in the first place. Nevertheless, Sunraku gains valuable knowledge and allies, critical for his advancement in the game. By seeking out powerful enemies and unraveling the inner workings of the game's world, Sunraku may just change Shangri-La Frontier forever.\n\n[Written by MAL

humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal Titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.\n\nAfter witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Eren, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman, and his childhood friend Armin Arlert join the brutal war against the Titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","mean":8.57,"rank":115,"popularity":1,"num_list_users":4257537,"num_scoring_users":2997880,"nsfw":"white","created_at":"2012-12-05T12:03:21Z","updated_at":"2024-08-17T18:09:07Z","media_type":"tv","status":"finished_airing","genres":[{"id":1,"name":"Action"},{"id":46,"name":"Award Winning"},{"id":8,"name":"Drama"},{"id":58,"name":"Gore"},{"id":38,"name":"Military"},{"id":27,"name":"Shounen"},{"id":76,"name":"Survival"},{"id":41,"name":"Suspense"}],"my_list_status":{"status":"completed","score":5,"num_episodes_watched":25,"is_rewatching":false,"updated_at":"2025-11-04T08:47:54Z","priority":0,"num_times_rewatched":0,"rewatch_value":0,"tags":null,"comments":"","start_date":"","finish_date":""},"num_episodes":25,"start_season":{"year":2013,"season":"spring"},"broadcast":{"day_of_the_week":"sunday","start_time":"01:58"},"source":"manga","average_episode_duration":1440,"rating":"r","pictures":[{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/47347.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/47347l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/55237.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/55237l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/56785.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/56785l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/56787.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/56787l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/60591.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/60591l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/60593.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/60593l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/63799.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/63799l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1409/104606.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1409/104606l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1907/134102.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1907/134102l.jpg"}],"background":"Shingeki no Kyojin adapts content from the first eight volumes of Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga of the same name.

Midori Imai, Shizuka Sakaki, and Misa Toudou—discovered their collective love for all things anime and formed the animation club. After making their first amateur anime together and showcasing it at the culture festival, the group vows to pursue careers in the industry, aiming to one day work together and create their own mainstream show.\n\nTwo and a half years later, Aoi and Ema have managed to land jobs at the illustrious Musashino Animation production company. The others, however, are finding it difficult to get their dream jobs. Shizuka is feeling the weight of not being recognized as a capable voice actor, Misa has a secure yet unsatisfying career designing 3D models for a car company, and Midori is a university student intent on pursuing her dream as a story writer. These five girls will learn that the path to success is one with many diversions, but dreams can still be achieved through perseverance and a touch of eccentric creativity.\n\n[Written by MAL

As a sous chef at his father's restaurant, he has spent years developing his culinary expertise and inventing new dishes to amaze their customers. He aspires to exceed his father's skill and take over the restaurant one day, but he is shocked to learn that Jouichirou is closing up the shop to take a job in New York.\n\nRather than tagging along with his father, Souma finds himself enrolling at the prestigious Tootsuki Culinary Academy, where only 10 percent of its students end up graduating. The school is famous for its \"Shokugeki\"—intense cooking competitions between students often used to settle debates and arguments. Jouichirou tells Souma that to surpass him and survive the next three years at Tootsuki and graduate there.\n\nThe academy's brutal curriculum and fiercely competitive student body await the young chef, who must learn to navigate the treacherous environment if he wants to stand a chance at realizing his dreams. But is skill alone enough to let him rise to the top?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","mean":8.12,"rank":520,"popularity":68,"num_list_users":1726491,"num_scoring_users":1044415,"nsfw":"white","created_at":"2014-10-28T22:16:25Z","updated_at":"2025-04-03T01:04:28Z","media_type":"tv","status":"finished_airing","genres":[{"id":9,"name":"Ecchi"},{"id":47,"name":"Gourmet"},{"id":23,"name":"School"},{"id":27,"name":"Shounen"}],"my_list_status":{"status":"completed","score":7,"num_episodes_watched":24,"is_rewatching":false,"updated_at":"2025-11-14T03:35:31Z","priority":0,"num_times_rewatched":0,"rewatch_value":0,"tags":null,"comments":"","start_date":"","finish_date":""},"num_episodes":24,"start_season":{"year":2015,"season":"spring"},"broadcast":{"day_of_the_week":"saturday","start_time":"02:25"},"source":"manga","average_episode_duration":1500,"rating":"pg_13","pictures":[{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/68293.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/68293l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/75713.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/75713l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/76426.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/76426l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/76427.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/76427l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1444/148976.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1444/148976l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1539/148977.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1539/148977l.jpg"}],"background":"Shokugeki no Souma was released on Blu-ray and DVD as Food Wars!

Norse to Hindu mythology—gather every one thousand years to make one important decision: whether or not to wipe out mankind. Repulsed by humanity's selfishness, the council unanimously votes to destroy all humans. But before the decree is enacted, Brunhilde, one of the 13 Valkyries of Valhalla, interrupts the meeting to give mankind a chance at survival. \n\nBrunhilde proposes the idea of enacting Ragnarök, an event in which the strongest 13 mortal warriors fight against 13 gods in one-on-one matches. Although the trial is ridiculed by the gods, the demigod takes advantage of their pride and forces them into an agreement. However, Brunhilde herself must recruit the mightiest heroes throughout humanity's thousand-year history and guide them to victory before they meet their untimely demise.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","mean":6.82,"rank":5420,"popularity":731,"num_list_users":364870,"num_scoring_users":207253,"nsfw":"white","created_at":"2020-12-19T03:55:21Z","updated_at":"2024-03-06T12:46:01Z","media_type":"ona","status":"finished_airing","genres":[{"id":1,"name":"Action"},{"id":8,"name":"Drama"},{"id":10,"name":"Fantasy"},{"id":58,"name":"Gore"},{"id":6,"name":"Mythology"},{"id":42,"name":"Seinen"}],"my_list_status":{"status":"completed","score":8,"num_episodes_watched":12,"is_rewatching":false,"updated_at":"2025-11-14T03:33:55Z","priority":0,"num_times_rewatched":0,"rewatch_value":0,"tags":null,"comments":"","start_date":"","finish_date":""},"num_episodes":12,"start_season":{"year":2021,"season":"spring"},"broadcast":{"day_of_the_week":"","start_time":""},"source":"manga","average_episode_duration":1480,"rating":"r","pictures":[{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1627/110801.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1627/110801l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1551/113460.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1551/113460l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1456/115123.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1456/115123l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1756/115125.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1756/115125l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1275/117706.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1275/117706l.jpg"}],"background":"Shuumatsu no Walküre premiered worldwide exclusively on Netflix on June 17, 2021.

Zeus, the head of gods, sends the demigod Heracles for the next round to avenge the humiliated Greek pantheon. To face this hero loved by gods and humans alike, the Valkyrie Brunhilde decides to use Heracles' complete moral opposite: the infamous serial killer Jack the Ripper—leaving human beings unsure who they should support.\n\nMeanwhile, tensions begin to rise between various divine pantheons, and rumors of a traitor jeopardize the unity of those who want to annihilate humanity. As the line between friend and foe becomes blurred, Brunhilde will do everything she can to make her machinations successful.\n\n[Written by MAL

However, a few are excluded from receiving a Gift, resulting in the others leaving them behind.\n\nYogiri Takatou, one of the students who did not receive a Gift, wakes up to find a dragon attacking the bus. Amidst the chaos, he executes the dragon using his innate ability to instantly put anything to death. Alongside fellow survivor Tomochika Dannoura, Takatou sets out to find a way back to Earth, all while eliminating anyone who dares to underestimate him—including his former classmates.\n\n[Written by

Together with his ditzy but well-meaning friend Mayuri Shiina and his roommate Itaru Hashida, Okabe founds the Future Gadget Laboratory in the hopes of creating technological innovations that baffle the human psyche. Despite claims of grandeur, the only notable \"gadget\" the trio have created is a microwave that has the mystifying power to turn bananas into green goo.\n\nHowever, when Okabe attends a conference on time travel, he experiences a series of strange events that lead him to believe that there is more to the \"Phone Microwave\" gadget than meets the eye. Apparently able to send text messages into the past using the microwave, Okabe dabbles further with the \"time machine,\" attracting the ire and attention of the mysterious organization SERN.\n\nDue to the novel discovery, Okabe and his friends find themselves in an ever-present danger. As he works to mitigate the damage his invention has caused to the timeline, Okabe fights a battle to not only save his loved ones but also to preserve his degrading sanity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","mean":9.07,"rank":4,"popularity":14,"num_list_users":2752587,"num_scoring_users":1490771,"nsfw":"white","created_at":"2010-07-26T09:23:40Z","updated_at":"2025-08-02T13:59:42Z","media_type":"tv","status":"finished_airing","genres":[{"id":8,"name":"Drama"},{"id":40,"name":"Psychological"},{"id":24,"name":"Sci-Fi"},{"id":41,"name":"Suspense"},{"id":78,"name":"Time Travel"}],"my_list_status":{"status":"completed","score":9,"num_episodes_watched":24,"is_rewatching":false,"updated_at":"2025-11-04T08:43:27Z","priority":0,"num_times_rewatched":0,"rewatch_value":0,"tags":null,"comments":"","start_date":"","finish_date":""},"num_episodes":24,"start_season":{"year":2011,"season":"spring"},"broadcast":{"day_of_the_week":"wednesday","start_time":"02:05"},"source":"visual_novel","average_episode_duration":1460,"rating":"pg_13","pictures":[{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/32023.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/32023l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/35137.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/35137l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/36433.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/36433l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1167/96846.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1167/96846l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1935/127974.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1935/127974l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1491/143199.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1491/143199l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1457/145286.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1457/145286l.jpg"}],"background":"Steins;Gate is based on 5pb. and Nitroplus' visual novel of the same title released in 2009.

former self. Depressed and traumatized after failing to rescue his friend Makise Kurisu, he has decided to forsake his mad scientist alter ego and live as an ordinary college student. Surrounded by friends who know little of his time travel experiences, Okabe spends his days trying to forget the horrors of his adventures alone. \n\nWhile working as a receptionist at a college technology forum, Okabe meets the short, spunky Maho Hiyajo, who \nlater turns out to be the interpreter at the forum's presentation, conducted by Professor Alexis Leskinen. In front of a stunned crowd, Alexis and Maho unveil Amadeus—a revolutionary AI capable of storing a person's memories and creating a perfect simulation of that person complete with their personality and quirks. Meeting with Maho and Alexis after the presentation, Okabe learns that the two were Kurisu's colleagues in university, and that they have simulated her in Amadeus. Hired by Alexis to research the simulation's behavior, Okabe is given the chance to interact with the shadow of a long-lost dear friend. Dangerously tangled in the past, Okabe must face the harsh reality and carefully maneuver around the disastrous consequences that come with disturbing the natural flow of time.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n","mean":8.55,"rank":126,"popularity":206,"num_list_users":935923,"num_scoring_users":462988,"nsfw":"white","created_at":"2015-03-28T23:40:55Z","updated_at":"2023-01-13T14:30:49Z","media_type":"tv","status":"finished_airing","genres":[{"id":8,"name":"Drama"},{"id":24,"name":"Sci-Fi"},{"id":41,"name":"Suspense"},{"id":78,"name":"Time Travel"}],"my_list_status":{"status":"completed","score":8,"num_episodes_watched":23,"is_rewatching":false,"updated_at":"2025-11-04T08:48:36Z","priority":0,"num_times_rewatched":0,"rewatch_value":0,"tags":null,"comments":"","start_date":"","finish_date":""},"num_episodes":23,"start_season":{"year":2018,"season":"spring"},"broadcast":{"day_of_the_week":"thursday","start_time":"01:35"},"source":"visual_novel","average_episode_duration":1420,"rating":"pg_13","pictures":[{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1653/93519.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1653/93519l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1768/93520.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1768/93520l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1375/93521.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1375/93521l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1743/93541.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1743/93541l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1554/98995.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1554/98995l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1242/143749.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1242/143749l.jpg"}],"background":"The Steins;Gate 0 anime partially adapts and continues the story of the visual novel of the same name.

He lands on Earth, but quickly finds himself in danger of captivity by its inhabitants. Fortunately, he is found by an unsmiling little girl named Shizuka Kuze, who feeds him and names him Takopii. Feeling indebted, Takopii decides to do everything in his power to bring a smile to her face.\n\nThe task is easier said than done, however. Shizuka is bullied by her classmates, she does not have a father, and her mother is never home—though the gravity of these issues flies over the naive Takopii's head. Even so, Shizuka does have one source of happiness: her dog Chappy. The connection Shizuka and Chappy share only increases Takopii's desire to make the girl smile.\n\nWhile Takopii's attempts to lift Shizuka's spirits lead to unintended consequences, he is determined to take things into his own tentacles, test his understanding of human beings, and achieve his goal of spreading happiness.\n\n[Written by MAL

enjoyed their lavish, peaceful, and prosperous lives for seven years since the day the almighty Spiral King was defeated—the day they reclaimed their homeland, Earth. However, the boon of this lifestyle leaves them unprepared when an unknown, hostile threat arises due to the ever-growing human population. This calamity is the Anti-Spiral—a fearsome enemy with unparalleled power. \n \nAs the Spiral King's prognosis postulating the destruction of \"The Spiral's World\" begins to come true, the pieces are in place, and Team Dai-Gurren is ready. With his late brother's hope to see a better future for mankind, Simon—along with Nia Teppelin and the rest of the team—is determined to overthrow the mighty Anti-Spiral in order to revive humanity's lost hope.\n\n[Written by MAL

no matter how knowledgeable or obsessed he was about it. Now reincarnated into his current royal lineage, he receives a body with seemingly endless mana, making his desire to master all things arcane attainable. Moreover, as the seventh prince of the kingdom, Lloyd has no claim to the throne, allowing him to nurture his abilities as freely as he wants.\n\nUnfortunately for Lloyd, ancient seals that imprison powerful demons begin to break down and release the horrors within, endangering the peace. With these monstrosities roaming around, Lloyd's overwhelming magical prowess is the ultimate weapon that can neutralize these threats before all things descend to chaos.\n\n[Written by MAL

In the midst of a casual encounter with his colleague, he falls victim to a random assailant on the streets and is stabbed. However, while succumbing to his injuries, a peculiar voice echoes in his mind, and recites a bunch of commands which the dying man cannot make sense of.\n\nWhen Satoru regains consciousness, he discovers that he has reincarnated as a goop of slime in an unfamiliar realm. In doing so, he acquires newfound skills—notably, the power to devour anything and mimic its appearance and abilities. He then stumbles upon the sealed Catastrophe-level monster \"Storm Dragon\" Veldora who had been sealed away for the past 300 years for devastating a town to ashes. Sympathetic to his predicament, Satoru befriends him, promising to assist in destroying the seal. In return, Veldora bestows upon him the name Rimuru Tempest to grant him divine protection. \n\nNow, liberated from the mundanities of his past life, Rimuru embarks on a fresh journey with a distinct goal in mind. As he grows accustomed to his new physique, his gooey antics ripple throughout the world, gradually altering his fate.\n\n[Written by MAL

slime Rimuru Tempest returns to his kingdom, eponymously named Tempest, just in time to begin negotiations with a nearby nation—the Kingdom of Eurazania. While the negotiations are anything but peaceful, they do end successfully, allowing Rimuru to return and finish teaching. When trying to again return to Tempest, this time permanently, Rimuru is stopped by a mysterious figure who is somehow able to constrain the many magical abilities he has at his disposal. \n\nIn Tempest, the situation is even worse. A group of unknown humans has invaded the land and are assaulting its citizens, both influential and innocent. They are not just trying to bring harm either—they have the intent to kill. Can Rimuru overcome his powerful and dangerous foe and return to Tempest before it is too late?  \n\n[Written by MAL

successfully overcoming the surprise attack from the Falmuth Army and the Western Holy Church. Beyond the festivities lies a meeting between Tempest and its allies to decide the future of the Nation of Monsters. The aftermath of the Falmuth invasion, Milim Nava's suspicious behavior, and the disappearance of Demon Lord Carrion—the problems seem to keep on piling up.\n\nRimuru Tempest, now awakened as a True Demon Lord, decides to go on the offensive against Clayman. With the fully revived Storm Dragon Veldora, Ultimate Skill Raphael, and other powerful comrades, the ruler of the Tempest is confident in taking down his enemies one by one until he can face the man

During his journey throughout different lands, he has even befriended the mythical wolf Fel and a slime named Sui. While enjoying a meal one day, the trio is interrupted by a tiny but rare pixie dragon who also wants a bite of their food. Like Fel and Sui, the dragon immediately falls in love with Mukouda's cooking and decides to become the man's familiar, receiving the name Dora-chan.\n\nHowever, cooking is not Mukouda's only forte. His familiars' incredible strength constantly attracts the attention of guilds who ask for their help on different quests. In exchange, the guilds are able to process the game Mukouda and his familiars hunt, enabling their growing party to sample various kinds of monster meat. Continuing to travel around the world with his familiars, Mukouda always comes up with new mouth-watering recipes that will leave everyone hoping for a second serving.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","mean":7.74,"rank":1260,"popularity":2531,"num_list_users":87189,"num_scoring_users":9539,"nsfw":"white","created_at":"2023-10-29T11:54:29Z","updated_at":"2025-11-14T03:12:25Z","media_type":"tv","status":"currently_airing","genres":[{"id":2,"name":"Adventure"},{"id":4,"name":"Comedy"},{"id":10,"name":"Fantasy"},{"id":47,"name":"Gourmet"},{"id":62,"name":"Isekai"}],"my_list_status":{"status":"watching","score":0,"num_episodes_watched":12,"is_rewatching":false,"updated_at":"2025-11-25T02:42:49Z","priority":0,"num_times_rewatched":0,"rewatch_value":0,"tags":null,"comments":"","start_date":"","finish_date":""},"num_episodes":12,"start_season":{"year":2025,"season":"fall"},"broadcast":{"day_of_the_week":"wednesday","start_time":"00:00"},"source":"light_novel","average_episode_duration":1435,"rating":"pg_13","pictures":[{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1018/149619.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1018/149619l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1474/149785.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1474/149785l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1636/150256.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1636/150256l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1215/150497.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1215/150497l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1885/151119.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1885/151119l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1932/151618.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1932/151618l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1206/151772.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1206/151772l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1778/152192.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1778/152192l.jpg"}],"background":"","related_anime":[{"node":{"id":53446,"title":"Tondemo Skill de Isekai Hourou Meshi","main_picture":{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1661/131889.webp","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1661/131889l.webp"},"alternative_titles":{"synonyms":null,"en":"","ja":""},"start_date":"","end_date":"","synopsis":"","mean":0,"rank":0,"popularity":0,"num_list_users":0,"num_scoring_users":0,"nsfw":"","created_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","updated_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","media_type":"","status":"","genres":null,"my_list_status":{"status":"","score":0,"num_episodes_watched":0,"is_rewatching":false,"updated_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","priority":0,"num_times_rewatched":0,"rewatch_value":0,"tags":null,"comments":"","start_date":"","finish_date":""},"num_episodes":0,"start_season":{"year":0,"season":""},"broadcast":{"day_of_the_week":"","start_time":""},"source":"","average_episode_duration":0,"rating":"","pictures":null,"background":"","related_anime":null,"related_manga":null,"recommendations":null,"studios":null,"statistics":{"status":{"watching":"","completed":"","on_hold":"","dropped":"","plan_to_watch":""},"num_list_users":0}},"relation_type":"prequel","relation_type_formatted":"Prequel"}],"related_manga":[],"recommendations":[],"studios":[{"id":569,"name":"MAPPA"}],"statistics":{"status":{"watching":"","completed":"","on_hold":"","dropped":"","plan_to_watch":""},"num_list_users":0}},{"id":56662,"title":"Trillion Game","main_picture":{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1081/147379.webp","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1081/147379l.webp"},"alternative_titles":{"synonyms":["$1,000,000,000,000 Game"],"en":"TRILLION GAME","ja":"トリリオンゲーム"},"start_date":"2024-10-04","end_date":"2025-03-28","synopsis":"After socially awkward technology specialist Manabu \"Gaku\" Taira is saved from thugs by the outgoing Haru Tennouji, the two men find that they get along with each other well.

goddess and his parents years ago, Makoto Misumi finds himself sent to another world to meet the goddess and become the hero. However, the deity deems Makoto to be \"hideous,\" refusing to even lay eyes upon him and revokes his heroic title. Disdainfully giving him the ability to understand all languages except the human language as compensation, the goddess drives Makoto off to the farthest edges of the wasteland, far from human civilization.\n\nDue to the disparity between Earth and this new world, Makoto's inherent physical and magical capabilities awaken, making him extremely powerful. He meets various demihumans and mythical beings who all end up being captivated with his characteristics and join Makoto in building a new community where all of them can peacefully coexist.\n\nNevertheless, despite this success, Makoto still yearns to meet fellow humans. In a world where the goddess herself has barred him from interacting with his kind, it is up to Makoto and his companions to fulfill his desire—and perhaps reform society along the way.\n\n[Written by

It's said to be warm and fertile, a place where there would be no need for fighting—not at all like the frozen village in Iceland where he was born, and certainly not like his current life as a mercenary. War is his home now. Though his father once told him, \"You have no enemies, nobody does. There is nobody who it's okay to hurt,\" as he grew, Thorfinn knew that nothing was further from the truth.\n\nThe war between England and the Danes grows worse with each passing year. Death has become commonplace, and the viking mercenaries are loving every moment of it. Allying with either side will cause a massive swing in the balance of power, and the vikings are happy to make names for themselves and take any spoils they earn along the way. Among the chaos, Thorfinn must take his revenge and kill Askeladd, the man who murdered his father. The only paradise for the vikings, it seems, is the era of war and death that rages on.\n\n[Written by MAL

Unfortunately, the club has been disbanded and he takes it upon himself to revive it by finding students who are willing to join. Without much luck, Onoda decides to make a round trip to Akihabara on his old, bulky city bicycle, a weekly 90-kilometer ride he has been completing since fourth grade.\n \nThis is when he meets fellow first year student, Shunsuke Imaizumi, a determined cyclist who is using the school's steep incline for practice.

wands, cloaks, and royalty. Although she studies at Tristain Academy, a prestigious school for magicians, she has a major problem: Louise is unable to cast magic properly, earning her the nickname of \"Louise the Zero\" from her classmates.\n\nWhen the first year students are required to perform a summoning ritual, Louise's summoning results in a catastrophic explosion! Everyone deems this to be yet another failure, but when the smoke clears, a boy named Saito Hiraga appears. Now Louise's familiar, Saito is treated as a slave, forced to clean her clothes and eat off the ground. But when an unfamiliar brand is found etched on Saito's hand from the summoning ritual, it is believed to be the mark of a powerful familiar named Gandalfr.\n\nWild, adventurous, and explosive, Zero no Tsukaima follows Saito as he comes to terms with his new life and as Louise proves that there is more to her than her nickname suggests.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","mean":7.2,"rank":3520,"popularity":244,"num_list_users":858583,"num_scoring_users":481437,"nsfw":"white","created_at":"2006-07-09T02:19:03Z","updated_at":"2023-01-07T09:15:45Z","media_type":"tv","status":"finished_airing","genres":[{"id":1,"name":"Action"},{"id":2,"name":"Adventure"},{"id":4,"name":"Comedy"},{"id":9,"name":"Ecchi"},{"id":10,"name":"Fantasy"},{"id":35,"name":"Harem"},{"id":62,"name":"Isekai"},{"id":22,"name":"Romance"},{"id":23,"name":"School"}],"my_list_status":{"status":"completed","score":8,"num_episodes_watched":13,"is_rewatching":false,"updated_at":"2025-11-14T10:40:11Z","priority":0,"num_times_rewatched":0,"rewatch_value":0,"tags":null,"comments":"","start_date":"","finish_date":""},"num_episodes":13,"start_season":{"year":2006,"season":"summer"},"broadcast":{"day_of_the_week":"monday","start_time":"00:30"},"source":"light_novel","average_episode_duration":1419,"rating":"pg_13","pictures":[{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/4721.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/4721l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/9592.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/9592l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/10137.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/10137l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/17784.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/17784l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/19970.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/19970l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/19972.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/19972l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/20680.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/20680l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/22132.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/22132l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/23483.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/23483l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/23484.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/23484l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/23485.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/23485l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/23486.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/23486l.jpg"}],"background":"Geneon Entertainment USA licensed the anime up until it's closure.

public, concealing their true thoughts and struggles beneath elaborate lies. Fans buy into these fabrications, showering their idols with undying love and support, until something breaks the illusion. Sixteen-year-old rising star Ai Hoshino of pop idol group B Komachi has the world captivated; however, when she announces a hiatus due to health concerns, the news causes many to become worried.\n\nAs a huge fan of Ai, gynecologist Gorou Amemiya cheers her on from his countryside medical practice, wishing he could meet her in person one day. His wish comes true when Ai shows up at his hospital—not sick, but pregnant with twins! While the doctor promises Ai to safely deliver her children, he wonders if this encounter with the idol will forever change the nature of his relationship with her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","mean":8.55,"rank":128,"popularity":183,"num_list_users":995901,"num_scoring_users":587648,"nsfw":"white","created_at":"2022-06-09T13:01:38Z","updated_at":"2025-06-02T22:44:13Z","media_type":"tv","status":"finished_airing","genres":[{"id":46,"name":"Award Winning"},{"id":8,"name":"Drama"},{"id":72,"name":"Reincarnation"},{"id":42,"name":"Seinen"},{"id":75,"name":"Showbiz"}],"my_list_status":{"status":"completed","score":8,"num_episodes_watched":11,"is_rewatching":false,"updated_at":"2025-11-25T10:01:34Z","priority":0,"num_times_rewatched":0,"rewatch_value":0,"tags":null,"comments":"","start_date":"2025-11-25","finish_date":"2025-11-25"},"num_episodes":11,"start_season":{"year":2023,"season":"spring"},"broadcast":{"day_of_the_week":"wednesday","start_time":"23:00"},"source":"manga","average_episode_duration":1837,"rating":"pg_13","pictures":[{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1077/124345.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1077/124345l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1081/124704.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1081/124704l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1828/129095.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1828/129095l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1444/131774.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1444/131774l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1812/134736.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1812/134736l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1987/135628.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1987/135628l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1442/136458.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1442/136458l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1908/136987.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1908/136987l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1443/139354.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1443/139354l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1363/139355.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1363/139355l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1867/139356.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1867/139356l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1591/139357.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1591/139357l.jpg"},{"medium":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1112/139358.jpg","large":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1112/139358l.jpg"}],"background":"[Oshi no Ko] adapts the first 4 volumes of Aka Akasaka \u0026 Mengo Yokoyari's manga series of the same name.
